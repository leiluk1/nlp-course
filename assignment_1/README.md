## Assignment 1

The assignment consists of two tasks focused on tokenizing text from Twitter(X) user posts (tweets). It involves implementation of [Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07909.pdf) algorithm and analysis of tokenization tecnique on two datasets: the tweets dataset ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15x_wPAflvYQ2Xh38iNQGrqUIWLj5l5Nw/view)) and the Italian speech dataset ([link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/z-uo/male-LJSpeech-italian/tree/main)). Both datasets are available as zip files in this folder.

The main solution can be found in the `Assignment1.ipynb` notebook. It contains the algorithm implementation, step-by-step instructions, and analysis for each task.
