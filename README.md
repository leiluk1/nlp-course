## Assignment Structure

Each assignment is organized into a separate folder and contains the necessary notebooks with code, data, and instructions to complete the task. Inside each assignment folder, you will find a detailed `README` file with instructions on how to proceed, a `requirements.txt` file with neccessary dependencies to be installed as well as any additional resources or references that might be helpful.


## Getting Started

To get started, it is recommended to have a compatible version of Python 3.9.13 installed on your system. You will also need to install the required libraries and dependencies, which can be found in the `requirements.txt` file in each assignment folder.
